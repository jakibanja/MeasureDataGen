# Presentation: HEDIS Intelligence Dashboard
**Sub-title**: Scaling High-Fidelity Clinical Mockups for MY 2026

---

## 🖥️ Slide 1: Title & Vision
- **Header**: HEDIS Intelligence Dashboard
- **Sub-header**: The "Logic OS" for Scenario-Driven Data Generation
- **Visual Description**: Screenshot of the new Dashboard with "System Health" badges glowing.
- **Key Message**: Transitioning from "Random Data" to "High-Fidelity Clinical Scenarios."

---

## ❓ Slide 2: The Data Gap
- **The Problem**: Conventional mockup generators produce "messy" data that fails clinical logic audits.
  - Manual Excel updates are slow and error-prone.
  - Randomized codes lead to HEDIS evidence failures (e.g., wrong NDC for a Statin therapy).
  - Lack of traceability between test scenarios and generated tables.

---

## 🚀 Slide 3: The Solution: "Fidelity First"
- **The Innovation**: A multi-layered engine designed to prioritize **Fidelity** over randomness.
  - **Scenario-Driven**: Every row in the visit/RX table is a direct child of a HEDIS test scenario.
  - **Smart Routing**: Technical intelligence that knows where a code belongs (NDC -> RX, CPT -> Visit).
  - **Zero-Loss UI**: A professional Command Center that orchestrates the entire pipeline.

---

## 🧬 Slide 4: Clinical Intelligence (The NDC Master)
- **Key Breakthrough**: Integration of the **HEDIS MY 2026 Medication Directory**.
  - **Scale**: Instant access to **342 HEDIS Value Sets**.
  - **Accuracy**: Real-time lookup of over **17,000 official codes**.
  - **Smart Adherence**: Automatic 90-day supply defaults for maintenance medications to satisfy PDC (Proportion of Days Covered) rules.

---

## 🔍 Slide 5: The "No-Touch" Audit Engine
- **VSD Integration**: Direct sync with the 180,000-entry **NCQA Value Set Directory**.
- **Bias Correction**: Randomized code selection that favors HEDIS-compliant evidence.
- **Gender-Aware Logic**: Sub-measure stratification (e.g., Male 21-75 vs. Female 40-75 for SPCE).
- **Automated Validation**: Integrated reporting that checks if the generated data *actually* passes NCQA rules.

---

## 🎨 Slide 6: The User Experience (UX Evolution)
- **Before**: Raw terminal outputs and static Excel templates.
- **Now**: The "HEDIS Logic OS"
  - **Sidebar Workspace**: Unified tabs for Ingest, Generate, and Audit.
  - **System Health Monitor**: Live verification of VSD and NDC file presence.
  - **Real-time Audit Stream**: "Glass-box" visibility into engine logic during generation.

---

## 📊 Slide 7: Success Metrics (Proof of Concept)
- **SPCE Measure**: 369 members, 2153 visits, and 369 pharmacy claims generated in < 140 seconds.
- **PSA/SMD Stability**: 100% regression pass rate after clinical engine upgrades.
- **NDC Fidelity**: Successfully replaced all placeholders with **Real HEDIS 2026 Codes**.

---

## 🗺️ Slide 8: Future Roadmap
- **NL-to-Mockup**: Natural Language prompts to generate HEDIS YAML configs.
- **ECDS Support**: Race/Ethnicity (SNS rules) stratification.
- **Batch Stress Testing**: Running 10+ measures in a single unified session.

---

## 🎬 Slide 9: Closing & Q&A
- **Summary**: High-fidelity, compliant, and scalable.
- **Action**: Ready for MY 2026 production testing.
